#  Title: app.py

#  Description: Contains APIs for processing receipts and calculating 
#  points based on specific criteria. It provides two endpoints: 
#  1. "/receipts/process" - Processes the JSON receipt and returns a unique ID for the receipt.
#  2. "/receipts/<id>/points" - Retrieves the points associated with a receipt using its ID.
#  The APIs use the dictionary "receiptDict" to store the points associated with each receipt ID.
